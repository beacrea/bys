					<h1 class="blue1">Logo Creation</h1>
					<p>Logo creation is probably one of the most fun projects we get, especially when it's for startups. When you start from the ground up and from a blank slate, you can always create something awesome. For new businesses, this is potentially the launching point for the next few years and their image is a critical factor in their success.</p>
					<p>Our process for creating logos starts with a questionaire that ranges from questions about your target audience to what your company would be like if it were a celebrity. By getting a great feel on a client's vision for their company and the information from our questions, we can craft you a great look for your shiny new startup.</p>
					<p>Like all the BYS products, we follow a formula that gets you a great logo quickly and inexpensively. We can make up to two different concepts, with two major revisions each (but usually we nail it).</p>
					<p>When we're done, you get all the artwork (a production and final AI file + fonts). Enjoy!</p>

					<h1 class="blue1">Business Cards</h1>
					<p>We love business cards. Everything from the ink, to the stock, to the noise a card makes when you snap a corner. When you hand someone a great card, that first impression is everything. If you really want to look great as you run around getting exposure, look no further.</p>
					<p>We typically create our artwork in illustrator or indesign. We can create for all sizes, as long as it's stated up front. We also have printers on hand to help you out so you don't have to worry.</p>
					<p>Typically, we start off with some sketches on what the cards will look like and then move right into the design. You'll get one concept and two revisions with this one.</p>

					<p><-- This cool guy is Coty Beasley. He runs a nifty design company called <a href="http://beasleycreative.com" target="_blank">Beasley Creative</a> in Kansas City, MO.
					
					<p>"I've had the pleasure of working in a co-working space and run into entrepreneurs with great ideas, but many have a limited budget.</p>
					<p>I created BYS as a way to still help new businesses out by offering design with restrictive scopes. Each of the products listed here have a strict process that's followed in order to keep time and resources in check, yet still deliver a customized and polished look.</p>
					<p>I hope you like the experience and feel free to <span class="orange">let us know</span> if we can help you grow in other ways."</p>

			<h1>960 Grid</h1>
			<p>Ok so the 960 Grid is what you would expect most modern websites to follow as its set up to be a max width of 960px which will fit the most common screen resolution 1024x768.</p>
			<p>Now to date I have not found a simpler way to build a website than this system which only relays on the below code to achieve a solid website. And as most new browsers excepting the "Media Queries" code we are now able to resize the grid based on your screen resolution so if you were to view this on say an iPhone you would get an optimized version of the grid which means you no longer have to zoom in to see text on a website. (<em>Go on give it a try now and see the below stay responsive..!</em>)</p>
